            <p><b>Janmashtami</b> is celebrated as the birthday of <b>Lord Krishna</b> who is considered as Lord Vishnu’s incarnation. According to the Hindu calendar, Krishna was born on the eighth day of Shravan month. This auspicious day is celebrated in many different ways. Some people visit the temple and prepare a cradle of flowers in which a small miniature of Lord Krishna is placed while others cut a cucumber which signifies the mother’s womb and celebrate Lord Krishna’s birth. Devotees of Krishna celebrate this day with zeal and enthusiasm.</p>
                
            <p>It is said that Krishna was born approximately <b>5200 years ago</b> in Mathura and the sole aim of his birth was to free the earth from evil powers. He was a legend who was born in the darkness inside the cell of a jail as his parents were captured behind the bars. This cruel act was done by his uncle. Krishna was the son of Devaki and Vasudeva but he was raised by his foster parents Nanda and Yashoda. It is said that when Krishna was born, all the guards in the jail slept off, chains were broken and doors opened automatically. He was born at midnight and that is why the festival is celebrated at midnight 12. </p>
